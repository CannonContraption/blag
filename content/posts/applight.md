Sometimes, you can say a lot with few words. Sometimes, you can also do a lot with few apps. I don't use big apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, not just for privacy reasons, but because they don't fit my lifestyle. I use email, a browser, the camera, a calendar, and a few other things, and that's it. All generic apps you can switch out. So, I use LineageOS*, and I don't have the Play services. No Play Store at all on my Android phone. Ironically, I use it more when it has less for me to use. Having less than two pages of apps is just like having a clean room, it makes the room more of a joy to use.

\* I'll review LineageOS later. It deserves it for other reasons.
