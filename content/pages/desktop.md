# Welcome to the Desktop Site!

-----

This is a showcase of windowTools and widgetTools, two projects I helped develop in college. I wrote the vast majority of the logic to make them work, and I also designed every piece of the graphics and visual style.

All of my posts are available to browse here, if you prefer this interface. Simply open the main menu in the bottom left, then pick a category. The interface should feel familiar. Bear in mind, however, that due to a shortcoming in how some browsers render iframes, you may need to move slowly when resizing and moving a post on the screen.

This was the original interface for #!/bin/bash it 'till it works from when I first ported it away from Blogger in June, 2018. You can see [my series on blogging]({tag}blog) for the whole story. Note that clicking that link will pull you out of the desktop for now, maybe I'll change that at some point.
