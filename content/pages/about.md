Title: About
Slug: about

Hi! I'm Jim Read, a software engineer in Massachusetts, currently working as a freelancer and writing my own software.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:jimmydean886@hotmail.com?subject=Hello!) with feedback, suggestions, or just to say hello!

I love little UNIX tools, and making them work efficiently together to solve complex (but highly pratical) problems, from simple file management to converting a complex directory tree of videos into audio files in order to effectively edit a virtual choir in a real DAW, all in one step.

My projects live all over the place, but most of my new ones are published to Gitlab. I also have a YouTube channel and a SoundCloud page, neither of which have been updated in years (though you can still check them out if you're interested!)

Links to all of this are in the footer.
